# Focus

Many small business owners, particularly those with businesses that have become successful without an official model, struggle to prioritize and delegate the various activities that allow a business to be maintenanced regularly and draw new clients. 

Focus is a Single Page app designed to help small business owners organize their responsibilities into categories of activities and then activities themselves.

The user will able to create, read, add, edit and delete activities, as well as to check off checklist items. This app will help the small business owner to eliminate distractions, group all daily and longer term objectives in one place, and allow tracking for all activities.

The backend solution of this application can be opened and run in Visual Studio, and then simultaneously the frontend code can be opened in Visual Studio Code and "yarn start" entered into the VS Code terminal. The browser window will display the interface which will then be  connected to the backend api. Activities can then be created, updated, and deleted.

Necessary libraries to be installed into the VS Code terminal include "Yarn add moment" (for the time stamp function) and "Yarn add confetti-js --save" (for the confetti visual effect when user clicks checkbox to complete an activity).
